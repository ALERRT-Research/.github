# ALERRT Research

This is where all code for ALERRT research projects will be archived. I want to propose two naming conventions to help keep things organized:  
1. Use snake_case for all repos
2. Use "DATA_" and "PROJ_" prefixed in repo names to help differentiate between repos set up for data curation (e.g., the TAMU dataset) vs analyses for publications
