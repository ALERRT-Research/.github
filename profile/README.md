# ALERRT Research

This is where all code for ALERRT research projects will be archived. I want to propose two naming conventions to help keep things organized:  
1. Use snake_case for all repos
2. Use "DATA_" and "PROJ_" prefixed in repo names to help differentiate between repos set up for data curation (e.g., the TAMU dataset) vs analyses for publications
Let me know if those work for you, Hunter.
I'm sure we'll be adding alot more structure later on but this is good for now.
